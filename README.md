# Timus (WIP)

Make your own version of JavaScript.

## About

Timus is an open-source project, made to facilitate the teaching of programming for those who do not know how to read and write in English.

It also happens to be a really fun project for anyone that wants to create his/her own version of JavaScript.

## Motivation (short version)

The vast majority of programming languages use English words in their syntax. This is a major hindrance to the programming learning process for those who do not know how to read and write in English.

Programming is a lot like writing. The same attributes of a good text are also valid to characterize a good program. Clarity, precision, simplicity, objectivity, balance are the resources that can be used to use both in the production of a text and a program.

How can we acquire these skills if we do not know very well the meaning of the words that are used in the text of a program?

This may not be your problem, but to try to better explain our motivation, consider the code snippet below, written in JavaScript:

```javascript
function factorial(n) {
    if (n === 0)
        return 1;
    return n * factorial(n - 1);
}
```

Now imagine if this same code was written in another programming language. This language use words that you don't know very well what they mean:

```
biczro factorial(n) {
    swpo (n === 0)
        rotwpo 1;
    rotwpo n * factorial(n - 1);
}
```

Probably the way you read the code above is very similar to the way programmers who cannot read and write in English see programs written in traditional programming languages.

Our main goal is to facilitate the learning of programming and to enable new programmers to know how to create and write good programs.

The difficulty with the English language makes many learn by decorating how things are done and not trying to understand the concepts and ideas involved.

We emphasize that we do not seek in any way to replace the programming languages used today. The programming world is in English and we strongly encourage learning English and other languages to create professional and personal opportunities.
